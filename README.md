# Image Simulator

A simple automation tool I made for a client to merge two image files of same size and returns combined image file.

## Concept

App url: `/autogen/:filename` accepts a parameter of a filename (combination of two files required). From that parameter, it takes the two image files from two different sources, one is downloaded from remote source and the other is taken locally in the project. Then creates the combined image file and returned as output.

## Installation

Clone the project and run `npm install` to install dependencies. Run `node app.js` to start the app.
